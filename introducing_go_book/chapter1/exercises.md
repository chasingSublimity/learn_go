1. What is whitespace?
  - Space inbetween code. Ignored, for the most part, by the compiler. Used to format code for readability...hopefully.

2. What is a comment? What are the two ways of writing a comment?
  - Text in the codebase that is ignored by the compiler.
  - Single line comments - // comment text...
  - Single line comments - /* comment text... \*/

3. Our program began with package main. What would the files in the fmt package begin with? We used the Println function defined in the fmt package. If you wanted to use the Exit function from the os package, what would you need to do?
  - package fmt
  - os.Exit()

4. Modify the program we wrote so that instead of printing "Hello, World" it prints "Hello, my name is" followed by your name.
  - fmt.Println("Hello, my name is Blake")
